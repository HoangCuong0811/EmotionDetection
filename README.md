# EmotionDetection# Real-Time Emotion Detection using CNN

## 📌 Introduction
This project implements **Real-Time Emotion Detection** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. It detects human emotions from facial expressions and can process both **static images** and **real-time video streams** from an integrated camera.

## 📌 Motivation
Emotion recognition has various applications in fields such as:
- **Mental health monitoring** 🏥
- **Education** 📚 (adaptive learning based on student emotions)
- **Marketing and customer engagement** 🛒 (understanding customer reactions)

## 📌 How It Works
The project uses a **CNN-based model** trained on an emotion recognition dataset. The model extracts key facial features and classifies them into different emotional categories.

## 📌 Features
✅ **Real-time emotion detection** using a webcam  
✅ **Deep learning-based feature extraction** via CNN  
✅ **Max Pooling, Dropout, and Dense layers** for optimized performance  
✅ **Multi-class classification** of human emotions  

## 📌 Dataset
The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing facial images categorized into emotions such as:
- **Happy 😊**
- **Sad 😢**
- **Angry 😠**
- **Surprised 😲**
- **Neutral 😐**
- **Fear 😨**

## 📌 Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of:
- **Convolutional Layers** (for feature extraction)
- **Max Pooling** (for down-sampling important features)
- **Dropout** (to prevent overfitting)
- **Fully Connected (Dense) Layers** (for final classification)
